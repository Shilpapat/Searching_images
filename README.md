# Searching_images
searching images based on input given 
Objective : Searching the high quality images by giving a valid input in search bar.
Implementation : 
I have created a html document to create the valid layout to fit the images in the page.
Javascript is used to get access the images from unsplash.com based on input given in search bar.
Steps to create account in unsplash.com
1. To access the images in unsplash.com you have to create the account there
2. after creating the account you shoud enter into menubar on right side and click on Developers/API which is there in Product section.
3. Then you have to create your first application where you have allow all permissions or if already created then goto Your apps.
4. After creating the application you should go down to check the access key which will be used in the javascript page in the url.
5. To get the url you should go to View your documentation dection which is beside Your apps.
6. After entering into documentation got to Search photos by keyword
7. Then search for url and add all necessary requirements in the url according to the page,query and client_id.
8. In this way you will be dealing with upsplash.com account and url to access images.
That's all then run the web application to get more attratractive images.
Best of luck.
